## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Olivia, and I'm an aspiring software developer passionate about all things Python and Backend Devolopment!

- Iâ€™m currently working on an OpenAPI project called ChatCBD, coding an AI that becomes less and less grounded in reality as conversation progresses(as if on CBD).
- Iâ€™m currently building my knowledge in Object Oriented Programming.
- Fun fact: I'm big on music and art, loving to paint murals and play guitar on my free time!
